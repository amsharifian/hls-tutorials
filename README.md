# HLS Tutorials

I relized that working with HLS tools is always an obstacle for both software and hardware engineers. While the main goal of HLS tools was providing a new paradigm for both software and hardware engineers to have a common language to design their accelerators, but the ad-hoc of software/hardware optimization of these frameworks becomes confusing instead clear for the users.

That was my motivation in the curse of my Phd to provide a new framework that beginners feel more confortable while they design their accelerator (muIR). But this doese not neglect the efforts that has been put on HLS and how it can be effective and efficient for designing hardware. Therefore, I decided to put some basic and advance topics in this repo to show the steps that are needed to use an HLS tool and optimize the design.


## Part 1 -- Hello to HLS world

In the first example, I picked `vector add` example as the basic function that you may want to use to target HLS and optimize the design.
